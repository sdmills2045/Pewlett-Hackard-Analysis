# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Module 7 Challenge

## Overview of Project 

Pewlett-Hackard is interested in identifying the number of employees that will retire in the upcoming years and the departments and positions it will affect. An analysis will provide a list of employees that will be eligible for retirement. This list will be used by Pewlett-Hackard to plan for future staffing needs. 


### Analysis Results

1. The analysis provides a list of 7 departments that will be impacted by future retirements.



2. The analysis provides a list of 72,458 employees that will be eligible for future retirement. (list truncated.)





3. The analysis provides a list of 1,549 employees that will be considered for mentorship eligibility. (list truncated.) 




### Analysis Summary

How many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact?

The analysis identified 72,458 employees that are eligible for the upcoming retirement package. As we can see by the title breakdown, this will have a major impact on senior level and experienced people. This movement can also be considered a brain drain on the company.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

	The analysis identified 1,549 employees that are eligible for the 	mentorship program. This is roughly 2% of the gap created by 		retirement eligible employees. Pewlett Hackard needs to go back to
	the drawing board regarding the proposed mentoring program.
